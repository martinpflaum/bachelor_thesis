Hello we used some code from https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch. 

About the Licence:
I am not related to nvdia in any way. It is important this code in generall is licence under the licence found in nvlicence.txt. All code that i wrote is of course also licence under MIT licence. All code in core.py all files in data_utils and data, and importance.py is under MIT licence i probably will write the licence specifically in every file. You also can write an issue if you are not sure about the licence

I changed some stuff in the nvdia code since i had problems with the jit compiler of the cuda code.

Interesting Part:
With '''
python script.py 
'''
you can run the programm with different settings. The results will be automatically put in the results folder.

In core.py is the main functionality.
